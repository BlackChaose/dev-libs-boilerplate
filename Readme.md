## boilerplate for development libs

### @Attention!!!
1) ***configure package.json & webpack.config.js - write your paths to project files!!!***

2) *** npm install here, and npm install in folder src - if your lib required another libraries...  ***

3) npm start in console and npm build in another console ( running watch for local dev server & and watch for repack files)
